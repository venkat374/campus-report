my goal is to design and implement a basic event reporting system for the campus event management platform.

my tasks are the following:

### design:
1. A feature to create events.
2. A feature to register students.
3. A feature to track attendance.
4. A feature to give feedback.

***

### database:
1. Create a table with a Sketch
    - college_id (a unique id for the college)
    - student_id (a unique id for a student from the college)

***

### API:
1. Endpoints for the features created.

***

### edge cases:
1. Tackle edge cases like duplicate registration, missing feed back and cancelled events.

***

### deliverable:
1. Working prototype of the implementation.
